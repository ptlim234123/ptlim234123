RockFire Grill,"A wretched restaurant I will forever remember; I almost died eating their overseasoned wings. Besides that, from the burger I got from there, it was alright.",34.41286973,-119.8577301,https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/rockfire-rocks-into-isla-vista/,https://dailynexus.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Siavash-Ghadiri_New-Openings_ONLINE-4.jpg
Children's Fairyland,I used to go to this amusement park all the time for field trips during elementary school. Very fond memories here. It's pretty small and gets boring kinda quick if you go here a bunch of times for field trips.,37.80880152,-122.2603131,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Fairyland,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Fairyland_shoe_entrance.jpg/440px-Fairyland_shoe_entrance.jpg
Lake Merrit,"This lake is really close to Fairyland. It is a toxic man made sludge of a lake that is heavily polluted. I have gagged multiple times here from the pure stench it emanates. Worst of all, my high school was too poor and I had to go here multiple times for PE. God forbid, I don't know what the swimming team had to deal with.

American Indian Public High School,"This is my old high school. It has cool people, but god dang, was it a joke. We basically had substitute teachers 24/7 here. They're also technically renting the campus -- it was originallly an elementary school. It's also near Lake Merrit and has a lot of scandals associated with it.

Lincoln Square Park,"This is pretty nice park. We used to go here sometimes for PE during middle school (our middle school shared the same branch with our high school, and yes, we didn't have gym during middle school). Our campus for our middle school was literallly a small bank, so obviously there wasn't a gym. This was nicer since it was near an actual school that used the park, and unlike the other parks we went to, there wasn't a lot of trash or waste.
